  I like tools. Screwdriver. Drone. Shovel. Calculus. Chainsaw. JavaScript. Excavator. CSS.
  Leatherman.
  <br />
  Tools help me tinker. You know: experiment, break things, Google a fix, find
  something better, repeat.
  <br />
  The web has so many tools it's hard to keep up. Tools that interact with all
  the cool sensors that are in our pockets. Tools with the power to connect
  every person on the planet.
  <br />
  For all my tinkering with different tools over the tools, code and the web has
  fast become my favourite.
